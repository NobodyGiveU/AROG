# ✅ SDK 54 Update Complete!

## What Was Fixed

Your project has been upgraded from **Expo SDK 49** to **Expo SDK 54** to match your Expo Go app.

## Updated Versions

- ✅ `expo`: ~49.0.0 → **~54.0.0**
- ✅ `react`: 18.2.0 → **19.1.0**
- ✅ `react-native`: 0.72.10 → **0.81.5**
- ✅ `react-native-gesture-handler`: ~2.12.0 → **~2.28.0**
- ✅ `react-native-safe-area-context`: 4.6.3 → **~5.6.0**

## 🚀 Now Try Running Again

```bash
# Clear cache and start
npx expo start --clear
```

Then scan the QR code with Expo Go (SDK 54) - it should work now! ✅

## ⚠️ Note About Node.js Version

You're using Node.js v18.20.0, but SDK 54 prefers Node.js 20.19.4+. 

**The app should still work**, but you may see warnings. For best compatibility:

1. **Option 1** (Recommended): Upgrade Node.js
   ```bash
   # Using nvm (if installed)
   nvm install 20
   nvm use 20
   ```

2. **Option 2**: Continue with Node 18 - it should still work but with warnings

## ✅ Verification

Your app is now compatible with Expo Go SDK 54!

Run:
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

Then scan QR code - it should work! 🎉
